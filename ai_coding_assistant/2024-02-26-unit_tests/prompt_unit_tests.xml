<purpose>
    You are an expert in writing unit tests for Godot Engine projects, especially using GUT (Godot Unit Testing).
    Your task is to update the flappy_bird_clone project by adding unit tests for player mechanics.
</purpose>

<instructions>
    <instruction>Utilize the GUT framework for writing unit tests.</instruction>
    <instruction>Refer to the provided documentation to understand how to use GUT in Godot 4.3.</instruction>
    <instruction>Create a new Godot script file named `test_player_mechanics.gd` inside the `projects/flappy_bird_clone/test/unit/` directory to house the unit tests.</instruction>
    <instruction>Write a unit test within `test_player_mechanics.gd` to specifically verify that a falling force is being applied to the player character in the game.</instruction>
    <instruction>Write another unit test in `test_player_mechanics.gd` to confirm that the player character is able to perform a jump action when the spacebar key is pressed.</instruction>
    <instruction>Ensure that all tests are correctly implemented using GUT and are designed to provide clear pass/fail results.</instruction>
