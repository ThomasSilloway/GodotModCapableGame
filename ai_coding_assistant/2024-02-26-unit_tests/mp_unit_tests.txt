Purpose: Update an existing godot 4.3 project called flappy_bird_clone with some unit tests for the player mechanics
Instructions:
	Use GUT for unit testing, see attached documentation in the context
	Create all tests in projects/flappy_bird_clone/test/unit/test_player_mechanics.gd
	Create test to confirm that falling force is applied to player
	Create test to confirm that player can jump when spacebar is pressed
	Future update: It didn't leave await frames after the player input, so that caused the tests to fail
Sections: current_scene_structure
