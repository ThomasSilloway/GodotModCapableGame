Purpose: Update an existing godot 4.3 project called flappy_bird_clone with a feature script obstacles that the player can run into, write unit tests, and run the unit tests to verify the changes
Instructions:
	Add a variable to flappy_bird_settings.gd and the .tres file called obstacle_speed
	Add a script called obstacle.gd which moves the obstacles to the left at a constant speed, use the setting from previous step
	Add a script called obstacle_half.gd to handle collision detection with the player.
	Update obstacle_half.gd to reset the game when a collision is detected with the player
	Update the appropriate .tscn files to add the scripts to the appropriate nodes
	Use GUT for unit testing, see attached documentation in the context
	Create all tests in projects/flappy_bird_clone/test/unit/test_obstacle_mechanics.gd
	Add await time of at least 3 frames after any player input in the tests
	Create test to confirm that the obstacle moves to the left at the correct speed
	Create test to confirm that the game is reset when a collision is detected with the player
	Double check that all of the instructions have been followed and implemented correctly
	Verify the functionality by running the tests using run_tests.bat
