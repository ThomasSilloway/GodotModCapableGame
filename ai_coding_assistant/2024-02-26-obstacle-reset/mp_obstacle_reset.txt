Purpose: Update an existing godot 4.3 project called flappy_bird_clone with a feature: when obstacles go off the screen, move them off screen to the right, so they can be re-used
Instructions:
	Add a variable to flappy_bird_settings.gd and the .tres file called obstacle_reset_distance
	Update obstacle.gd to detect collision from either of its obstacle_half nodes with the ScreenEdgeCollider
	When collision is detected, move the obstacle to the right by the obstacle_reset_distance

	Update the appropriate .tscn files to add the scripts to the appropriate nodes
	Use GUT for unit testing, see attached documentation in the context
	Create all tests in projects/flappy_bird_clone/test/unit/test_obstacle_reset.gd
	Add await time of at least 3 frames after any player input in the tests
	Create tests to confirm the new feature works as expected
	Double check that all of the instructions have been followed and implemented correctly
